# Learning: React Native

In this folder, I am learning [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/). 

I am following along on [this course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-react-native-and-redux-course/) by [Stephen Grider](https://github.com/stephengrider) to learn it.

## RN Apps

Current apps include:
- [Albums](https://github.com/zanedb/learning/tree/master/react-native/albums) (demo app that displays album art, name, URL, and more via API request)
- [Auth](https://github.com/zanedb/learning/tree/master/react-native/auth) (in development, simple authentication demo via Firebase)
